## How to Use      
Navigate to https://alyssahellrung.github.io/mathFlashCards. Right away, you will be presented with the first math problem.  
<img src="./images/shot1.png" width="250" height="300" />  
When you click anywhere on the card, it will flip over to reveal the answer.     
<img src="./images/shot2.png" width="250" height="300" />     
You can click on the card as many times as you want to see the question and answer, but when you are ready to move to the next question, click the "Next Card" button and you will see the next problem.  
<img src="./images/shot3.png" width="250" height="300" />       
Every time you load the app, the cards will shuffle, so you will get the cards in a different order each time!

## How and Why I Made This    
My daughter is learning her times tables, so I made her some physical flashcards on paper to help with memorization. As I was writing them all out, I thought, "Why not just make an app for this?" I found an excellent card-flipping animation tutorial by Tyler Potts (https://tinyurl.com/8g4krws9) for the action of the cards. I chose to bring in the data and shuffle it (using the Durstenfeld shuffle) so that the user is presented with the problems in a different order every time.
